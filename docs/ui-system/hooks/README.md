This document lists and describes all custom hooks available in the Xala UI System, with links to detailed guides for each.

## Available Hooks

- [useTokens](./useTokens.md): Access current theme's design tokens (colors, spacing, typography, etc.)
- [useLocalization](./useLocalization.md): Access and switch the current locale, translate keys
- [Other hooks]: Add documentation for any additional hooks (e.g., useTheme, useRTL, useBreakpoint) as needed

All hooks are strictly typed, SSR-compatible, and follow SOLID and accessibility/compliance best practices.
